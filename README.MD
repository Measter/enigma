# Rust Enigma

This is a Rust port of Mike Pence's [Java Enigma](https://github.com/mikepound/enigma). This uses the same
algorithm as his version, so for or an explanation of how it works, please read his readme.

## How to Run

You'll need a [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). With that, you can run the example
with this command:

```
cargo run --release --example video
```
